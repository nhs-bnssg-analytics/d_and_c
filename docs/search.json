    "text": "Data description\nAn approximate model of how demand and capacity metrics can be seen below:\n\n\n\nApproximate schematic of relationships between demand and capacity and performance\n\n\n\nChallenges\nThere are some challenges in standardising the publicly available data. Data are published for different geographies, at different frequencies, for different time periods.\nGeographies pose the biggest challenge. The aim of this project is to predict performance at ICB geography from the input metrics. The input metrics are published at geographies and locations such as provider trust (including different sites within trusts), STP, CCG, PCT, ICB, Region, Local Authority. Within a metric, the geography can change over time - for example, reporting at CCG changes to ICB when CCGs were abolished.\nThe next geography challenge is how data published at a smaller geography gets assigned to a larger geography. A simple example is for NHS Provider Trusts. The simple method is to assign the Trust the ICB that the Trust is located within. Undoubtedly, the Trust will be treating patients that reside outside the ICB it is located in, so policies created externally to the Trust will be having an effect on its performance (DISCUSSIONAL POINT).\nFrequencies pose a different challenge. Data for the metrics used are published for different frequencies. These are daily, monthly, quarterly and annually (both calendar and financial years). As the modelling is at a high level with the aim to inform long-term planning performing the modelling at an annual basis is optimum. Generally, aggregating higher frequency metrics is a simple process of summing the numerator and the denominator, and then recalculating the metric. For some metrics this is more complicated. For example, the “No Criteria to Reside” metric, which publishes daily figures, provides information on the number of patients in each trust each day that no longer meet the criteria to reside (denominator), and of those patients, the number that remain in hospital (numerator). Aggregating this information up to annual figures by ICB will lose lots of the variation and detail that the daily figures provide, and potentially reduce their usefulness to the modelling.\nFinally, time periods provide a challenge. Some metrics begin and end at different times, which makes it more difficult to be able to use them to predict into the future.\n\n\nData description\nThe metrics collated for the project are described in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomain\nmetric\n\n\n\n\nCapacity\nESR absence (acute organisation type)\n\n\nCapacity\nESR absence (ambulance organisation type)\n\n\nCapacity\nESR absence (community provider trust organisation type)\n\n\nCapacity\nESR absence (mental health organisation type)\n\n\nCapacity\nESR absence (others organisation type)\n\n\nCapacity\nESR absence (pct organisation type)\n\n\nCapacity\nGross Total Expenditure (£000s) per individual with long term support during the year\n\n\nCapacity\nNumber of clinical workforce (FTE) in general practice per 10,000 registered patients (PCN average applied to all practices in the PCN)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Ambulance staff)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Associate Specialist)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Central functions)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Consultant)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Core Training)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Foundation Doctor Year 1)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Foundation Doctor Year 2)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (HCHS Doctors)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Hospital Practitioner / Clinical Assistant)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Hotel, property & estates)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Managers)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Midwives)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (NHS infrastructure support)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Nurses & health visitors)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Other and Local HCHS Doctor Grades)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Other staff or those with unknown classification)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Professionally qualified clinical staff)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Scientific, therapeutic & technical staff)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Senior managers)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Specialty Doctor)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Specialty Registrar)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Staff Grade)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Support to ST&T staff)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Support to ambulance staff)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Support to clinical staff)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Support to doctors, nurses & midwives)\n\n\nCapacity\nWorkforce FTEs per 10,000 population (Total)\n\n\nCapacity\nbed availability - day - General & Acute\n\n\nCapacity\nbed availability - day - Learning Disabilities\n\n\nCapacity\nbed availability - day - Maternity\n\n\nCapacity\nbed availability - day - Mental Illness\n\n\nCapacity\nbed availability - day - Total\n\n\nCapacity\nbed availability - overnight - General & Acute\n\n\nCapacity\nbed availability - overnight - Learning Disabilities\n\n\nCapacity\nbed availability - overnight - Maternity\n\n\nCapacity\nbed availability - overnight - Mental Illness\n\n\nCapacity\nbed availability - overnight - Total\n\n\nDemand\n% active smokers (GPPS)\n\n\nDemand\n% former smokers (GPPS)\n\n\nDemand\nAtrial fibrillation: QOF prevalence (all ages)\n\n\nDemand\nCVD-PP: QOF prevalence (30-74 yrs) - retired after 2019/20\n\n\nDemand\nDepression: QOF prevalence (18+ yrs)\n\n\nDemand\nEstimated prevalence of common mental disorders: % of population aged 16 & over\n\n\nDemand\nEstimated prevalence of common mental disorders: % of population aged 65 & over\n\n\nDemand\nHypertension: QOF prevalence (all ages)\n\n\nDemand\nLast BP reading of patients (80+ yrs, with hypertension), in the last 12 months is &lt;= 150/90 mmHg (denominator incl.

While some geographies map coterminously with Integrated Care System geographies, some approximate methods of aggregation are needed for the ones that don’t.\n\n\n\nData are published at different time periods and frequencies. Data are generally published based on regulatory requirements. Metrics can change over time as well. Therefore, metrics may exist for a few years and then stop being published. Equally, metrics may only be introduced very recently.\n\n\n\nMetrics can be published by month, quarter, and year (both financial or calendar). The outputs of the project are intended to inform long term strategic planning, so the shorter frequency metrics are aggregated up to an annual time period to allow for annual predictions.\n\n\n\nData are generally published as raw figures. Without context, it is difficult to evaluate whether a figure is high or low. For added context, the metric needs to be calculated with some sort of denominator. This enables comparison with other areas. The choice of denominator determines the metric value and it can have a large influence on how the metric differs between areas. The description of the metric, along with the denominator and numerator description, can be found in the configuration-table.csv file.\n\n\n\nThere are challenges around interpretation of metrics. The value of a metric can be influenced by many factors. To ensure that the outputs are practical, these factors need to be considered at all stages to ensure the metrics are most useful to the end user.\n\n\n\nThe pandemic period will heavily influence a lot of metrics. Each metric may have been influenced in different ways and not represent business-as-usual, therefore relationships between metrics may drastically differ during that period from the non-pandemic period.

Using temporal data on demand (e.g., population in older age groups) and capacity (e.g., social care funding) at ICS geography as model inputs, this project aims to predict performance metrics (e.g., No Criteria to Reside remaining in hospital) using modern spatio-temporal modelling techniques. The project would use publicly available data to generate predictions for each ICS. It would also identify which input metrics have the biggest influence on the performance metric being predicted."

    "text": "Questions this work can support\nConceptually, the performance metrics should be impacted by the demand and capacity handles. Some of the demand and capacity metrics are ones that can be influenced by policy and investment. This work should be able to identify significant associations between the demand and capacity metrics and the resulting performance. This will help support high-level prioritisation for investment and policy making. For example, if it can be shown there is a strong relationship between social care funding and reducing No Criteria to Reside patients, this can be used to make a strong case for increasing social care funding, if this will be more than offset by the acute cost saving."

The baseline modelling will first produce a ‘do nothing’ performance trajectory, based on current/expected levels of demand and capacity. It will then allow users, through ‘what-if’ scenario analysis, to sensitivity test the models for future years to understand how changes to the input metrics will affect future predictions – thus allowing them to inform more optimal decisions on future spend and resource allocation."

    "text": "There are limitations with the data processing related to:\n\n\nData are published at different geographies. While some geographies map coterminously with Integrated Care System geographies, some approximate methods of aggregation are needed for the ones that don’t.\n\n\n\nData are published at different time periods and frequencies. Data are generally published based on regulatory requirements. Metrics can change over time as well. Therefore, metrics may exist for a few years and then stop being published. Equally, metrics may only be introduced very recently.\n\n\n\nMetrics can be published by month, quarter, and year (both financial or calendar). The outputs of the project are intended to inform long term strategic planning, so the shorter frequency metrics are aggregated up to an annual time period to allow for annual predictions.\n\n\n\nData are generally published as raw figures. Without context, it is difficult to evaluate whether a figure is high or low. For added context, the metric needs to be calculated with some sort of denominator. This enables comparison with other areas. The choice of denominator determines the metric value and it can have a large influence on how the metric differs between areas. The description of the metric, along with the denominator and numerator description, can be found in the configuration-table.csv file.\n\n\n\nThere are challenges around interpretation of metrics. The value of a metric can be influenced by many factors. To ensure that the outputs are practical, these factors need to be considered at all stages to ensure the metrics are most useful to the end user.\n\n\n\nThe pandemic period will heavily influence a lot of metrics. Each metric may have been influenced in different ways and not represent business-as-usual, therefore relationships between metrics may drastically differ during that period from the non-pandemic period. This will impact any predictive model."
