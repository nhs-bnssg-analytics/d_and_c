# d_and_c

The goal of d_and_c is to explore the possibility of modelling high
level NHS performance at Integrated Care Board geography using publicly
available data.

**NOTE, this is currently work in progress**

The repository is managed using `renv`, so the aim is for it to be
reproducible by anyone with access to the same versions of R and RStudio
that I use. After cloning and opening the project for the first time,
run `renv::restore()` in the console to install all the versions of the
packages used in this work.
