## Introduction and aims

The aims of this project are to use publicly available data to find associations between performance within Integrated Care Systems, and different demand and capacity metrics.

The strong associations can then be explored as to whether there are actions that can be taken to improve performance.

### Project aims

A summary of the aims of the project (which will need refining over time!):

-   Identify associations between metrics that affect performance
-   Enable long term decision making
-   Forecast future performance based on different scenarios
-   Open source and reproducible code
