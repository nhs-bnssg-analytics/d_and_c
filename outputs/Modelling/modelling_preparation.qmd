## Data structure

The project aims to allow us to predict the value of a performance metric in future years (1, 2, 5 years, say) for each of the ICSs. Performance metrics could be impacted by demand and capacity metrics for the same years, or potentially years building up to that year.

To enable testing different models, the data structure should consider the following for each ICS and each year:

* a value for each target variable (performance metrics) - required
* a value for each predictor variable (demand and capacity metrics) - optional
* a lagged value (1 to x years lag) for target and predictor variable - optional

## Missing data

The input data has missing values. The data needs more investigation as to why it is missing (it could be really missing, eg, data not submitted, or it could be a zero, eg, a zero numerator for that metric).
